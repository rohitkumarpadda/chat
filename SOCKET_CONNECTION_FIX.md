# Socket Connection Fix

## Problem
After successful login, the console showed:
- ✅ "Login successful"  
- ❌ "disconnected" 

The socket was connecting but immediately disconnecting.

## Root Cause

The original `SocketProvider.tsx` had a critical flaw:

```typescript
// OLD CODE - BROKEN
const socket = io(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URI); // ❌ Created at module load time

export const SocketProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const { accessToken } = useAuth();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Later tries to update headers
    socket.io.opts.extraHeaders = {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    };
    socket.disconnect().connect();
  }, [accessToken]);
```

**Issues:**
1. **Socket created too early** - Created at module load time, before user logs in
2. **No initial auth** - First connection had NO Authorization header
3. **Backend requires auth** - Server immediately disconnects unauthenticated sockets

**Flow:**
```
Page loads → Socket created (no token) → Connects → Backend: "Unauthorized" → Disconnects ❌
User logs in → Token available → Socket updates headers → Reconnects → Should work ✅
```

But the damage was done - the first connection attempt failed.

## Solution

Completely rewrote `SocketProvider.tsx` to:

1. **Wait for auth token** - Don't create socket until we have a token
2. **Include token from start** - Pass Authorization header on socket creation
3. **Recreate on token change** - When token changes (login/logout), create new socket
4. **Proper cleanup** - Disconnect old socket before creating new one

```typescript
// NEW CODE - FIXED
export const SocketProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState<Socket | null>(null);
  const { accessToken } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Don't create socket if no token
    if (!accessToken) {
      if (socket) {
        socket.disconnect();
        setSocket(null);
      }
      return;
    }

    // Create socket WITH auth token from the start
    const newSocket = io(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URI!, {
      extraHeaders: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, // ✅ Token included from start
      },
    });

    // Event handlers
    newSocket.on('connect', () => console.log('✅ Socket connected'));
    newSocket.on('disconnect', (reason) => console.log('❌ Disconnected:', reason));
    newSocket.on('error', (error) => console.error('❌ Socket error:', error));

    setSocket(newSocket);

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      newSocket.disconnect();
    };
  }, [accessToken]); // Recreate when token changes

  return (
    <SocketContext.Provider value={{ socket, connected }}>
      {children}
    </SocketContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Token-First Approach**
- ✅ Socket is created ONLY when token exists
- ✅ Token is included in initial connection
- ✅ Backend authenticates successfully on first connect

### 2. **Proper State Management**
- ✅ Socket is now in React state (not module-level)
- ✅ Can be `null` when user is logged out
- ✅ Recreated when user logs in/out

### 3. **Better Logging**
- ✅ Emojis for visual clarity (✅/❌)
- ✅ More descriptive messages
- ✅ Error and exception handlers

### 4. **Clean Lifecycle**
```
No Token → No Socket → Login → Token Available → Socket Created with Auth ✅
                                Logout → Token Cleared → Socket Disconnected
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Login
```
Console: (nothing - no socket created)
```

### After Login
```
Console: Creating socket with auth token...
Console: ✅ Socket connected: abc123xyz
```

### After Logout
```
Console: No access token, disconnecting socket...
Console: ❌ Socket disconnected: io client disconnect
Console: Cleaning up socket...
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `apps/web/src/features/chat/context/SocketProvider.tsx` - Complete rewrite

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
cd apps/web
yarn dev

# 1. Open browser console
# 2. Go to login page - no socket should be created
# 3. Login - should see "✅ Socket connected"
# 4. Go to chat - socket should work
# 5. Logout - should see "❌ Socket disconnected"
```

### Production Testing
After deploying to Netlify:
1. Register/Login
2. Check browser console
3. Should see "✅ Socket connected" with socket ID
4. Should NOT see "disconnected" after connection

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**

git push
