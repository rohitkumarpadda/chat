# Netlify Build Fixes - Complete Summary

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing with exit code 1 during the build process. The errors were:
1. Invalid Next.js configuration (`transpilePackages` property)
2. TypeScript type mismatches between local and imported interfaces
3. Incorrect environment variable setup

## Root Causes

### 1. Next.js Configuration Issue
- **Problem**: `transpilePackages` was used as a root property in `next.config.js`
- **Cause**: In Next.js 13.0.0, this property must be under `experimental`
- **Fix**: Moved `transpilePackages` to `experimental.transpilePackages`

### 2. TypeScript Type Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple definitions of `IConversationRes` and `IUserDoc` causing type mismatches
- **Cause**: Local type definitions in ChatContext.ts conflicted with types from the `interfaces` package
- **Impact**: SWR's `KeyedMutator` type was incompatible, and Mongoose Document types had 50+ extra properties

### 3. Type System Issues
- **Problem**: `IUserDoc` from the `interfaces` package extends Mongoose `Document` with 50+ properties
- **Cause**: Frontend components were trying to use plain objects with Document types
- **Fix**: Created a simpler `IUser` type for frontend use

## Changes Made

### 1. `apps/web/next.config.js`
✅ Fixed `transpilePackages` configuration
```javascript
experimental: {
  transpilePackages: ['ui'],
}
```
✅ Added environment variable validation with clear error messages

### 2. `netlify.toml`
✅ Removed Netlify Next.js plugin (not installed)
✅ Simplified configuration
✅ Added proper publish directory

### 3. `apps/web/src/features/chat/context/ChatContext.ts`
✅ Removed duplicate `IConversationRes` interface
✅ Imported `IConversationResAPI` from `interfaces` package
✅ Created simple `IUser` interface for frontend (without Mongoose properties)
✅ Updated type references to use correct imports

### 4. `apps/web/src/features/chat/context/ChatProvider.tsx`
✅ Removed duplicate `IUserDoc` interface
✅ Imported `IUser` from ChatContext
✅ Updated type references in conversation mapping

### 5. `apps/web/src/features/common/components/ConversationItem.tsx`
✅ Added `IUser` to accepted user types
✅ Imported from `~/features/chat`

### 6. `apps/web/src/features/common/components/UserAvatar.tsx`
✅ Added support for local `IUser` type
✅ Renamed imports to avoid conflicts (`IUserAPI` and `IUserLocal`)

### 7. `packages/ui/package.json`
✅ Added React as `peerDependencies`

### 8. `.npmrc` (created)
✅ Added workspace support configuration

## Test Results

✅ **Local build successful**:
```
Tasks:    1 successful, 1 total
Time:    17.256s
```

✅ **No TypeScript errors**
✅ **No ESLint errors**
✅ **All pages compiled successfully**

## Deployment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables in Netlify Dashboard

**CRITICAL**: These MUST be set before deployment:

1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL**
   - Your backend API URL
   - Example: `https://cipherchat-api.onrender.com`

2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URI**
   - Your backend Socket.IO URL
   - Example: `https://cipherchat-api.onrender.com`

### Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify build: TypeScript types and Next.js config"
   git push
   ```

2. **Set environment variables in Netlify**:
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add both variables listed above

3. **Deploy**:
   - Netlify will auto-deploy from the push
   - Or manually trigger a deployment

## Build Command (from netlify.toml)
```bash
cd ../.. && yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn turbo run build --filter=cipherchat-web...
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Monorepo Type Safety**: Keep type definitions in shared packages to avoid conflicts
2. **Mongoose vs Plain Objects**: Use separate types for API (Mongoose Documents) vs Frontend (plain objects)
3. **Next.js Version Specifics**: Configuration properties vary between versions
4. **Environment Variable Validation**: Fail fast with clear messages when required vars are missing
